Decorator Pattern

Structural design -

uses recurssion, inhe5ritance and interfaces to add functionality
to a class at run time, either statically or dynamically without
altering the original classes structure.

We use it when:

- add to the behavior or state of an object
- modify a single object without altering others

super interface
